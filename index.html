				<h2>Srishti Singh</h2>
				<h3> <i>Jack of all trades, master of some</i> </h3>
				<p> Hi! I am a software engineer from India. <br>  <br>
 
					2010, I began on the journey of next 10 years (and probably lifetime) of programming starting with HTML, XML, C++ and SQL during high school. <br> <br>

					From 2015-2018, I became a programming polyglot, learning C, C++, C#, Java and Python during my Engineering (Computer Science) as part of the course. <br> <br>

					Year 2016, I spent learning complete web development stack, frontend and backend in PHP, SQL, JS. <br> <br>
					
					Spring 2017, I fell in love with the book "Discrete Mathematics by Kenneth Rosen", and that's what sparked my interest to get into Data Science. <br> <br>

					Fall 2018, I was introduced to Machine Learning during my final year of Engineering, and ML being more challenging than DS is what sparked my interest to get into ML, and also GANS. <br> <br>

					Since then I have been in an ON & OFF relationship with Machine Learning, because of my unrequited love for pure Mathematics (especially DM), and my undying curiosity for Robotics (especially things that fly), and overall an insatiable hunger for knowledge in the field of computer science.
					It's a paralyzing process of constant mind battles. <br> <br>

					In 2019, I joined a very young, early age startup, and worked as one of the lead and (and one of the only 4) developers on pre-seed super interesting projects (building MVPs, POCs) involving machine learning, NLP, data science, backend development, and full stack development. 
					Unfortunately we weren't lucky enough to go further with these projects. Thanks to Covid19. <br><br>

					Year 2021, I am on a career break, slightly unmotivated and indecisive about my next step in a career in software engineering. But still learning and building ML projects and pursuing passion projects. <br> <br>

					<b>I am always interested to work with non beurocratic young-fun-transparent-motivated teams building research oriented interesting projects, preferably in AI.</b><br> <br>
					
					And, I am not a big fan of "reverse this linked list" type of coding challenges. <br> <br>


					<!-- My recent and most interesting work experience was at an early stage startup doing a cross-functional development role working on social-media data mining and analysis (sentiment analysis, intent analysis, entity recognition, etc.), 
						with a focus on providing data-driven metrics to online content creators and analysing user-growth patterns on video streaming platforms like Youtube, building features and functionalities backed by data science/machine learning.<br> <br> -->
