				<h3> <i>Jack of all trades, master of some</i> </h3>
				<p> Hi! I am a software engineer from India. <br> 
					A highly passionate and capable full stack developer with a diverse background across wide range of software domain problems. I have done projects ranging from embedded programming to full stack web applications and to working on industry data science projects. <br>
					My recent and most interesting work experience was at an early stage startup doing a cross-functional development role working on social-media data mining and analysis (sentiment analysis, intent analysis, entity recognition, etc.), with a focus on providing data-driven metrics to online content creators and analysing user-growth patterns on video streaming platforms like Youtube, building features and functionalities backed by data science/machine learning.<br>
